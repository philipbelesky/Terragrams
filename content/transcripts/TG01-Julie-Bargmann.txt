`[00:00:00]` **Craig Verzone:** Welcome to Terragrams. Hi, I'm Craig  and I'll be your host for the first delivery of teragrams. Today. I am joined by Julie Bargmann of dirt studio in her Charlottesville, Virginia office. Julie's a principal of dirt studio and has developed and built her practice around ideas embedded in the remediation and reclamation of polluted sites.

`[00:00:51]` She's an associate professor at the university of Virginia. And the former director of the landscape architecture program, she's taught at the Harvard graduate school of design [00:01:00] and at the university of Minnesota, she has presented her research and work all over the country. She's a winner of the American Academy, Rome prize in landscape architecture.

`[00:01:09]` Of the national design award from the Cooper Hewitt national design museum. She's a recipient of a Graham foundation grant and she has been published in architecture, garden design ID, landscape journal, architectural record, and the public art review. And she's been featured in the popular media outlets.

`[00:01:28]` Of Newsweek time magazine, CNN NewsHour with Jim Lehrer, PRI studio three 60 and the New York times. We are truly honored to be here with you. Thanks so much for joining us and welcome to Tara Graham's Julie.

`[00:01:41]` **Julie Bargmann:** Thank you.

`[00:01:43]` **Craig Verzone:** Why don't we start right in the dirt. Dirt is an acronym. Can you tell us what it stands for?

`[00:01:50]` **Julie Bargmann:** It's initial, definition or, what it stands for is design investigations, reclaiming terrain. And that's it's academic origin,

`[00:01:59]` **Craig Verzone:** academic origin. Do you, are you inferring that the studio's name was founded in at a university?

`[00:02:06]` **Julie Bargmann:** Well, it started with research, which of course, when I was at the university of Minnesota and received a rather sizable grant upon coming, becoming an assistant professor there, I actually didn't know what research was.

`[00:02:19]` So I basically turned it into a road trip. And at that time, I just was like, well, I mean, Minnesota, I'm, I'm in, you know, iron range, mining territory. I've been interested in mind landscapes, ever since Robert Smithson's sort of left this world starting to investigate them. So that's when dirt happened.

`[00:02:46]` **Craig Verzone:** That's interesting. So the connection to your background as a sculpture. Into your work reclaimed sites is perhaps through Robert Smith.

`[00:02:58]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:02:58] Yeah, I would, I [00:03:00] would say so. I think that, that was the kind of first inkling of, you know, wow. That's pretty interesting stuff. also there's a bit of background in having worked with Michael van Valkenburgh and increasingly when he got public commissions.

`[00:03:18]`he was starting to work on some sites that had post-industrial histories and I found myself gravitating towards those.

`[00:03:26]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:03:26] What's the science to history in contemporary art?

`[00:03:30]`**Julie Bargmann:** [00:03:30] well maybe both. I think just the sites themselves, I just was very interested in those layers. Do

`[00:03:39]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:03:39] you think that there was that, interest in the layers was able to appear in the final product project?

`[00:03:48]` Were you able to UN on earth them and re reveal them?

`[00:03:55]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:03:55] I think that in the earlier projects, when it was [00:04:00] just kind of an undercurrent of an interest and effort to. Reveal those or make them part of really the design, you know, the built form of a place wasn't quite jelling quite yet. that, that took some time.

`[00:04:22]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:04:22] Did you find that there was a rift between your work as a sculptor and your work in these, these damaged sites that a rift that was hard to reconnect?

`[00:04:36]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:04:36] I don't know what you mean by rift.

`[00:04:39]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:04:39] Well, do you, do you, so did you, in your early work, in landscape architecture, did you still think of

`[00:04:44]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:04:44] yourself as a sculptor? I think I did in that I thought I'm remembering actually quite vividly my first year at design school and definitely a rift there between my art education and [00:05:00] design education.

`[00:05:01]` In that my, approach, may not have been kind of this problem solving kind of way that, you know, I thought design operated, you know, and in fact, I had some trouble, in that I think I was trying too hard to be a designer. And I had a great teacher, Sherry closing, who just said, stop that, you know, don't do that.

`[00:05:22]` You know, be who you are and the artists that you are. And, so my approach might be that I have to say in, in, in kind of thinking about that is I think that it's more the approach to projects. That is something that I've learned and tried to emulate in terms of. In artists and being an artist, you know, not kind of a formal thing, like, Oh, are you, is your work still sculptural?

`[00:05:51]` Right. You know what I mean? Maybe it is maybe there isn't, but more for me, more importantly, it was this idea of. [00:06:00] Attacking or addressing issues proactively in that that's what the artist's work was about. That they, they identified an issue. The girl are good artists. They identified an issue. And really went after it.

`[00:06:17]` You know, I'm thinking of artists like Mel chin, Marilou, Ukeles, listen, of course. and a lot of the kind of environmental artists whose work, I really respect and it's their, their process that I really respect. and you know, to me, that's, that's part of this kind of, you know, what designers would call it critical practice

`[00:06:38]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:06:38] until you would still consider yourself a sculptor.

`[00:06:42]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:06:42] In process? Yes.

`[00:06:45]`**Craig Verzone:** [00:06:45] about 15 or 16 years ago, you were in Rome comparing environmental art and ancient landscapes. back then, would you have expected to be where you are today?

`[00:06:56]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:06:56] Hm. Hm, [00:07:00] no, in that I. Was, although I think I was wondering what form my work was going to take, because it really was at a critical point, which is what's great about the Rome prize, where I had learned the craft, I was learning the craft with Michael van Valkenburgh, took, you know, a break from there.

`[00:07:23]` To go to Rome and felt like something was gurgling up. Wasn't quite sure what it was. And that's why I actually wanted to look at the ancient sites and the earth works just to kind of satisfy a curiosity there. And I think it was, what I think they shared was kind of a willfulness, with the landscape, That somehow I just was like, you know, I love that.

`[00:07:50]` And that's what I want to do. I want this kind of, you know, more willful sensitive, but not apologetic [00:08:00] approach. Were

`[00:08:03]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:08:03] there specific sites that you use that you studied in Rome?

`[00:08:06]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:08:06] Yeah. I bet the trust can landscapes. I just, you know, you know, you just always want to find out why they trust kids have a smile on their face all the time, so there's gotta be a reason.

`[00:08:17]`and I think that there was, I think what I found in them. as interpreted actually by this great book by DH Lawrence, the trust skins, which is kind of part fiction part fact is, and his kind of projection of what the trust is, what we're about is, kind of a free spirit, free spirited kind of instinctual, a soul felt way of occupying a site.

`[00:08:46]` You know, and marking, you know, a site, in a very, you know, human, you know, just soulful way. When you,

`[00:08:58]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:08:58] you went back to Cambridge [00:09:00] after being a fellow in Rome, was it easy to get back into the

`[00:09:04]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:09:04] rhythm? Yeah. You know, I returned to VanVulkenberg office and, I've always been, you know, very simpatico, with Michael and his and his work.

`[00:09:17]`so. That wasn't very hard at all, except that you could kind of get used to the Italian day and, and calendar, and going back into, you know, 60 and 80 hour weeks was a little intense, but I was anxious to get back to practice very anxious.

`[00:09:36]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:09:36] And so you spent two years, with Michael van Valkenburgh and then what.

`[00:09:39]` For all of you out to Minnesota.

`[00:09:41]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:09:41] Oh, who knows? But, well actually it was always, an interest in teaching. when I was at, you know, the graduate school of design, I was a teaching assistant, kind of worked my way through graduate school, and always enjoyed, the aspect of teaching. I felt it made me a better [00:10:00] designer, a better critic of my own work and of others.

`[00:10:05]` And, the call came out of the blue and it also coincided with a time to kind of strike

`[00:10:15]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:10:15] Michael. Must've been sad.

`[00:10:17]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:10:17] Well, it was pretty mutual actually. I think Michael felt it was time to nudge me out of the night, back

`[00:10:26]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:10:26] to dirt. How does the dirt studio. Function currently. And can you tell me a little bit about your team composition?

`[00:10:33]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:10:33] Well, dirt now actually is I like to think entering it's new, a new chapter. I don't know what that is yet, but, clearly it was a, a bit of a leap for me, to, team up with. managing partner, Chris Fannon, basically to actually embark on a new chapter for dirt studio, partly out of practicality, cause I was exhausting myself, running [00:11:00] dirt studio by myself, or however many years over a decade.

`[00:11:05]`and, but I still. 13 years. Thank you. Making me feel. but, and I've always, it's operated and we continue to operate with a very few other, employees. Usually it's just one right now and associate David Hill. And in the past I did kind of a classic thing where I asked people to work with me, when the projects demanded, right.

`[00:11:29]`Portant associate in pass was Joe Ragsdale a lot. They've been a lot of times. Of course they'd been former students. cause we just have a great, great pickins here. but the, the, the intent has always been to be very small and agile to become parts of teams. never been interested in.

`[00:11:55]` Developing a large practice that would be quite [00:12:00] complicated managerially, you know? And, so I liked it very much when a person, that I was collaborating with. Was asking me about the practice and she likened, we were working with KPF at the time and she likened dirt to a little speedboat that pulls up next to ocean liners like KPF.

`[00:12:21]` Yeah, big tankers who were slow to slow to turn.

`[00:12:25]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:12:25] What happens when that big, that big tanker comes into your port and you need to get up. Climb up and pilot into there.

`[00:12:35]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:12:35] Oh boy. you know, it, it varies. It goes, but I've, I pretty consistently found that, dirt is called in for pretty particular reasons.

`[00:12:48]`and there's an element. Of receptiveness, unless it's a been a, unless it's been a forced marriage, which I, I stay, I stay, I have had a few of, and I stay away [00:13:00] from now. but when it's, so them calling dirt hat is, you know, a very particular request and instill from there it's. It's a question, whether or not they're receptive to the ideas that we bring to the table.

`[00:13:19]` Do

`[00:13:19]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:13:19] you think this, your particularity, is it founded in, in reclaiming terrain? And would you say this is your specialty?

`[00:13:28]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:13:28] I, I think it's a specialty and a focus. I mean, we've actually, I had another colleague, come up with a great term of calling us industrial site architects. Actually to, for some clarity of what the focus of the work is, and also to actually help out on some design teams where there's been another landscape architect on the team.

`[00:13:51]` So they're like, why are there two landscapes?

`[00:13:53]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:13:53] Okay. I've noticed that in your team compositions, often you are parallel with other professionals who are [00:14:00] perhaps sharing the same responsibilities. Or could be,

`[00:14:04]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:14:04] could be, well, well, that's been a again, a very, there's varied amount of success in terms of those, those collaborations are those, some people would call joint ventures with other landscape architects.

`[00:14:16]` I think again, it takes, some alliances that are, receptive, to that kind of Alliance. but, There's been some very successful ones. And I like to think that we're building these kinds of alliances with all sorts of people, you know, other landscape, architects, engineers, scientists, architects.

`[00:14:35]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:14:35] Are you interested in widening the

`[00:14:36]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:14:36] scope, the scope of work? Well, you know, I there's been times where I felt like it would be a problem being pigeonholed. And that's why actually I. Try to expand the definition of I've actually started to use the word regenerative technologies versus remediation reclamation, because [00:15:00] there's a, for me in the word regeneration, there's the suggestion.

`[00:15:07]` Maybe just by virtue of its. Definition of creating a new, that those kinds of ideas can be applied to not just pass, which remediation reclamation apply to a lot, but to kind of future landscapes or, and, you know, quote unquote sustainable. I don't, you know, I avoid that word. I don't try not to use that word.

`[00:15:33]`and use regenerative instead. What are you working on now? right now the, primary project is, urban Outfitters. they're moving their whole, production, your works of over, 400 people and growing, to the Philadelphia Navy yard.

`[00:15:51]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:15:51] And could you describe a bit your intervention?

`[00:15:54]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:15:54] Well, we, they're occupying, four buildings, very large buildings, [00:16:00] at the historic core of that Navy yard, which is fantastically situated at the, access of broad street, right in line with city hall, on the Delaware river.

`[00:16:11]`and. basically, we're working on a very Mo in a very multidisciplinary team, of architects and other landscape architects slash civil engineer. So on and so forth, in basically doing what we hope we always say we do. And that is, reading the traces of that site. Respecting them and overlaying or building, I think within those races, this new inhabitation.

`[00:16:40]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:16:40] And how responsive has urban Outfitters been to your approach?

`[00:16:46]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:16:46] Well, it's pretty interesting in that. actually when we started the project urban Outfitters, revealed to us a lot of their, merchandising, secrets, but more importantly than that, their philosophies, behind [00:17:00] all their brands and.

`[00:17:02]` It was very interesting how inline it was in terms of there, their interest in the reuse of places, the patina, you know, places, again, their approach being, I think, a bit more stylistic. Then not, but we'll take that alignment. Okay.

`[00:17:27]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:17:27] This has, this has their branding facilitated some of the ideas that you've had facilitated the approval of some of the ideas you've had on the, on the project?

`[00:17:36]` I

`[00:17:37]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:17:37] think so. I think so it's also interfered. I mean, I had a knockout drag out that was extremely revealing where I tried to make. or I tried, I presented the argument for a certain aspect, certain, particularly scary contaminated place part of the site, the acid room. And [00:18:00] I argued for retaining more of the industrial traces of the production.

`[00:18:07]` And he I'll never forget. He treated me. He said, why should I care about this? And I said, because these represent 150 years of labor on this site before you got here.

`[00:18:21]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:18:21] Yeah. So the branding had its limits.

`[00:18:24]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:18:24] Yes.

`[00:18:25]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:18:25] What are some of the other components to

`[00:18:27]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:18:27] your project? the washing

`[00:18:29]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:18:29] to the acid, right?

`[00:18:30]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:18:30] Yeah. Well, the other is a, is a, one that I'm pretty excited about that, you know, I think that other people are getting at.

`[00:18:39]` With this kind of obsession with recycled things and, and it has to do with really some things that are dumb as dirt. And that is, a very practical thing of asking the question of where does all the material that gets demolished at a site go. Hmm. Hmm. And, [00:19:00] and wondering about that going well, wait a second.

`[00:19:04]` You know, can't a good amount of that be reused on the site. So we can really reduce the amount of material going off site into a landfill in New Jersey. so, we came up with this thing. I called Barney rubble. It's a paving, system that basically reuses giant chunks of concrete that get broken up on the site and they get reset.

`[00:19:30]` Oh in place. So do you

`[00:19:32]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:19:32] think that'll be able to go through

`[00:19:35]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:19:35] yeah, he, the owner absolutely loves it. Okay.

`[00:19:38]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:19:38] How big are your

`[00:19:39]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:19:39] pieces? Oh, you know, it kind of whatever the Jack hammer does, you know, and depends if the, you know, how reinforced the concrete is and, you know, but they range from, you know, four foot square, you know, Maybe down to, you know, a foot and half, two foot,

`[00:19:58]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:19:58] and will these big pieces be dry later [00:20:00] where you pour them in,

`[00:20:02]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:20:02] put them in place to date?

`[00:20:03]` The two ways we've done them is just dry late. And,

`[00:20:07]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:20:07] so you've already done parts.

`[00:20:10]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:20:10] Yeah. This is the second project we've worked. I, this is also the beauty of, of getting back to smaller scale projects. The time I. we first used Barney rebel was on a, a private, project, a former pump station in Dallas, Texas.

`[00:20:26]`and, so, that was kind of curious, you think in the context of one of the most affluent neighborhoods in. Dallas, something like broken concrete and wouldn't cut the mustard and, you know, it did. And so

`[00:20:42]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:20:42] is there a, will the urban Outfitters will be, there'd be a period of. teaching the workers how to do this because they're not accustomed to taking demolition.

`[00:20:53]` Oh,

`[00:20:53]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:20:53] they, they storing it in a per we are absolutely insane. Absolutely insane. And [00:21:00] actually nicely enough. That's what led to the full scale mockup was. They just said we have really art. We kind of know what you're talking about, but we don't know what you're talking about. We also were like, we don't know what's underground

`[00:21:11]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:21:11] and maybe they wanted to be sure they knew they.

`[00:21:15]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:21:15] Right, right, right. Which I have to say. The other thing that, you know, I have to say it has gone by the wayside. unfortunately with the Philadelphia Navy yard, is this issue of, of contamination on the site. as much as I tried to probe about that, the more and more it was kind of taken off the table.

`[00:21:37]` I don't think the contamination issues on the part of the site that we were working were. We're we're great. You know, just by knowing what processes took place there, but, oftentimes the problem over and over again is that we come into late,

`[00:21:55]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:21:55] given that healing landscape is such a long process. How do you know when it [00:22:00] finally

`[00:22:00]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:22:00] reclaimed?

`[00:22:01]` Hmm, Hmm. Oh boy. Well, I think it has to do well, actually you bring up a great point because one of the main things that is difficult well has to do with kind of the philosophy we're trying to bring to these projects. And that is conventional remediation, basically is about erasing the contamination.

`[00:22:27]` It's Haagen hall, which the boys. Call it any industry of excavator, Hoggin hall, excavation, and disposal, or cap and cover. Okay. Which is, you know, as it sounds, they, they, they cap, you know, with supposedly impervious or to avoid contact, you know, and quick kind of put on a green veneer. So nobody knows what really happened.

`[00:22:53]` So what, what remediation technologies and process that. We've [00:23:00] been advocating is a much, usually a much slower process of actually degrading the, you know, the contaminants degrading. You know, basically, truly dealing with the, the problem onsite, preferably in situ. And so that necessitates actually then this, the whole system of systems monitoring, which they actually do anyway, but we've been trying to kind of advocate that this monitoring.

`[00:23:34]`and the, the, the process of remediation become more legible and more accessible that actually the public is invited into these sites more immediately. And incrementally does it mean that you need to

`[00:23:50]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:23:50] hug and holler Kevin cover part of the site so that the other part of the site can be. Accessible for viewing.

`[00:23:57]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:23:57] I mean, often it does, but I mean, [00:24:00] in an ideal world, hugging hall and crap and cover isn't used at all, you know, I mean, in some projects, we've, propose that like you're, you're suggesting that the remediation. take place, over time, but preferably like on onsite, you know, so it's this cycle of like, okay, the toxic contaminates, the whale would be lugged to another part of the site, but remediated there and then brought back Brack on.

`[00:24:31]` So that's

`[00:24:33]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:24:33] like

`[00:24:37]` you're practicing in the field of reclaiming polluted wastelands. You are a

`[00:24:42]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:24:42] healer. Yeah.

`[00:24:44]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:24:44] Does this profound role levy at you from the set of cultural dimension of design?

`[00:24:51]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:24:51] Ouch. I must say that it's even become a pet peeve of mine, or I I've really, as you can hear, I [00:25:00] cringe when the word healer is being used or healing.

`[00:25:05]`I don't think of it that way. maybe I should, and there is an aspect of it, of that, but that's something that I allow other people to assign and if they want to call it that or call me that, that's fine. I see it as extremely practical and very common sense. I mean, the fact is is that, you know, the frontier is closed.

`[00:25:29]`You know, we've got to, you know, do something about these sites. You know, and they're, you know, the next place where we're moving. So to me, it's, it really is, is common sense. And in fact, I would argue that what I'm trying to bring to these sites is the aesthetic and the cultural value in actually just even the significance of the act.

`[00:25:59]` Of [00:26:00] reclaiming. Okay. As is a part of our culture. and also the act of making these transformations visible and legible as the primary static.

`[00:26:15]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:26:15] Do you have to grapple with the term or the idea of naturalism or the natural paradigm relative to ascetics because many people, I think that remediation or reclamation

`[00:26:29]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:26:29] means restoration

`[00:26:30]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:26:30] nature back in.

`[00:26:31]` And so there should be no aesthetic, a cultural dimension to it. How does this

`[00:26:37]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:26:37] Oh, big time. Big time, because yeah. Because of our, you know, kind of pastoral ideal right. Of, of nature, you know, capital land, you know, that gets imposed upon us building landscapes. completely, there's a battle there because especially with all the anxiety [00:27:00] around graded landscapes, it's sort of like quick.

`[00:27:04]` You know, make this look pastoral and ideal to me to make me comfortable.

`[00:27:13]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:27:13] Is there a funny segue between artificial industrial landscape alluded landscape artificial natural landscape that people need that natural landscape in order to erase the two phases of artificiality that that was on the

`[00:27:31]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:27:31] site.

`[00:27:32]` Yeah, again, I think that it's, it's a, it's a, a level of expectation that they have. and I was, I was just going to say too, what struck me in talking about this is how much I have been struck when working with communities that when you present. You know, or, represent to them, these landscapes, [00:28:00] these industrial landscapes, and put them, you know, into the question of, of beauty, you know, of a part of their landscape, a part of their landscape, their heritage it's so striking how many people come around and say, that's beautiful.

`[00:28:22]` They don't have, they don't really have the words for it, you know? And I think that is what I have found is the biggest thing that dirt has endeavored to accomplish. And that is try to develop a new landscape vocabulary. And so you've found

`[00:28:39]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:28:39] that people have been not very open

`[00:28:41]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:28:41] to. A lot of times, you know, I mean, I'll tell you, I mean, it, it, you know, certainly lets you know, things get sorted quickly, you know?

`[00:28:51]`in terms of that kind of stuff.

`[00:28:56]` Tell us a bit about your

`[00:28:57]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:28:57] super fund redevelopment initiative and it was on the [00:29:00] top of your list, right?

`[00:29:01]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:29:01] Oh, well. That must've been when I was feeling really good. It's not on the top of my list now. I, well, depending on who I'm pitching, you know, I, I, you put different, it

`[00:29:15]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:29:15] sounds ambitious.

`[00:29:16]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:29:16] It's ambitious.

`[00:29:18]`it was, this is where, you know, my research, you know, in my academic work world kind of meets my, practice. And that is that I got involved with a multi school, research initiative for the what's called the super fund redevelopment initiative, basically, an initiative that it was really trying to, evaluate the super fund program.

`[00:29:42]` And basically evaluate the problem that it, it has had in implementing a lot of it's, program. And it was, I mean, it was incredibly revealing, to just kind of get in the thick of it with the EPA. Yeah.

`[00:29:59]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:29:59] And who was the [00:30:00] initiative of the. Of

`[00:30:01]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:30:01] this initiative. Oh, actually, colleagues here in Charlottesville who, have a lot of experience with super fund sites and just really felt like it was a fantastic idea to get an academic, group together, to study it.

`[00:30:16]`and, it was fantastic. I, I got to, I took for this, it took the form of, some funded design studios to work with the students to, look at alternatives, of kind of what was, you know, what was, what was holding up where, what were the obstacles, in, AC super the Superfund program, but most, most importantly communities that have super fun sites in their midst.

`[00:30:41]` So, It was great, but it was incredibly frustrating. Does it have a future? It's the R our funded research is, is done finished. you know, and I, I think, you know, there was a good effort on our part to figure out how to perpetuate it. And I [00:31:00] think that, you know, we have a group of folks that are, are very simpatico and with their antenna up, to look for other.

`[00:31:08]` Projects, along these lines. but we'll see. I mean, you know how much the funding has been cut it, cut with the, you know, the EPA. So sometimes research initiatives like this are, are, are, the first things to get cut.

`[00:31:21]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:31:21] Maybe it's a springboard to something else.

`[00:31:23]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:31:23] Well, for me, you know, for me, it absolutely changed my attitude towards the PS.

`[00:31:30]` I used to just slam them all over the place. And I became very simpatico in that I thought, I think I saw much more clearly what they're up against. They have

`[00:31:44]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:31:44] difficult challenges.

`[00:31:45]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:31:45] Oh yeah. I mean, you know, they may have tied their own hands, but their hands are tied and, who. I learned, I learned a whole lot.

`[00:31:57]` And we'd like to think that w the, we taught the [00:32:00] EPA a lot. So one, one, actually one thing I would say the most significant lesson that came out of it was through my collaboration with architecture history colleague. And that is that we were, we were able to articulate the importance of the cultural value of these landscapes.

`[00:32:21]` Of the social value of these landscapes and the value of their histories and

`[00:32:26]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:32:26] do, and was, do you think their ears were open to that?

`[00:32:29]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:32:29] The head of Superfund at the end of this conference just said, the one thing he heard was he said, I hear you. And I think that they got the message that in there rather awkward, if not totally ineffective methods of trying to relate to the community.

`[00:32:50]`they realized that this could be a significant way to truly engage the community, you know, that they weren't, it took them [00:33:00] out of a defensive mode into much more of a collaboration with that community.

`[00:33:05]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:33:05] It seems like it would, could facilitate, many projects maybe remediation.

`[00:33:11]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:33:11] Oh yeah. Oh

`[00:33:12]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:33:12] yeah. I guess it would take in the middle of the problem.

`[00:33:17]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:33:17] Oh, by whom

`[00:33:19]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:33:19] I was in power.

`[00:33:23]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:33:23] Oh,

`[00:33:25]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:33:25] you were listening to Tara grams and our guest is truly Bargman. She is the principal of dirt studio and an assistant professor at the university of Virginia. How would you characterize the relationship between teaching your teaching in your practice? Because the two are very much.

`[00:33:41]`integrated.

`[00:33:43]`**Julie Bargmann:** [00:33:43] they are, I like to think of them as a very much a continuum. if I didn't, I'd be going out of my mind, in doing both. So one

`[00:33:52]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:33:52] job instead of

`[00:33:53]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:33:53] two. Yeah. It's my work. It's my work. and so [00:34:00] basically, I let my students, Get out all my frustrations that I have in practice

`[00:34:08]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:34:08] are they transferred

`[00:34:09]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:34:09] as well?

`[00:34:10]` What my frustration is, Oh, I tell war stories all the time in studio, you know, I just moan and groan and you know, but I think that, you know, basically I, I always give him the biggest dose of reality I can, in working on real projects in real time in real communities. With real communities, if possible.

`[00:34:34]`and, but they, they still are operating in the academic realm of, freedom to explore ideas that, I actually now use this as you know, I hold up as a model for myself in practice. I use, I use examples of my students' work all the time in practice. So

`[00:34:56]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:34:56] would you say they directly affect your work?

`[00:34:58]` The work of the students directly affects

`[00:34:59]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:34:59] your [00:35:00] work directly. And,

`[00:35:03]`**Craig Verzone:** [00:35:03] is there any one thing you believe teaching needs to focus on more teaching in landscape architecture department at the university level?

`[00:35:14]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:35:14] Well, I don't know. I mean, I'm always struck by how much it's evolved. I mean, I think I so often think about how, you know, it was when I was in graduate school and that's not that long ago. And, the, these, how, how, you know, design education right now is, is it's in my mind, sometimes it's just light years, you know, away from them in terms of, you know, the integration of social and cultural issues.

`[00:35:47]`you know, the currency of, of issues. I mean, I think, I think we've been in a way allowed to go there because I think that, there's always pioneers. [00:36:00] and they, you know, they kind of do the clearing in front of you. so

`[00:36:05]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:36:05] we have some of those pioneers

`[00:36:06]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:36:06] been. Well, when I, well, when I was in school, you know, it was uncle Pete, Pete Walker, and, aunt Martha, Martha Schwartz, Michael van Valkenburgh, was there the late Sherry cruising, George Hargraves came to visit, Beth Meyer.

`[00:36:23]`you know, and those were, you know, all the, you know, you know, young bucks, To just, have, you know, a profound effect, you know, on the, on practice and teaching. I mean, I think we're very fortunate that, you know, some of the best practitioners were also been teachers. I have also been teachers.

`[00:36:42]` Exactly. Right.

`[00:36:44]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:36:44] I see. Do you see any new pioneers out there?

`[00:36:50]` Is there, is there a passing of.

`[00:36:55]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:36:55] torch well, well, w w what I [00:37:00] often call the petticoat, generation, that have come out from underneath their skirts. Yeah. I mean, I'm one of them. And, I think that, I think there's, I think there's a fair number of folks like yourself that are. You know, are, are devoted to critical practices and, you know, teaching, I think maybe that could, be fortified a bit more.

`[00:37:26]` I think that there's been a pervasiveness of, the syndrome of, you know, your full time tenured faculty or nothing, and that's totally difficult practitioners.

`[00:37:37]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:37:37] And on the other hand, in the field of practice, do you think there's much opportunity for young. Small offices.

`[00:37:44]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:37:44] I think so.

`[00:37:45]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:37:45] How do they compete against the big behemoths?

`[00:37:47]` I

`[00:37:48]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:37:48] think, okay.

`[00:37:49]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:37:49] Now include Michael van Valkenburgh

`[00:37:52]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:37:52] Michael van Valkenburgh is

`[00:37:54]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:37:54] yeah. Huge. And Hargraves yeah,

`[00:37:57]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:37:57] they will exploded, you know, grew [00:38:00] up, know who out. but the smaller firms, I think, I think very much, you know, rates similarly to what I was saying earlier with their, I think they, I think they are, in the mode of, you know, of what I think a lot of projects call for now and even RFPs, you know, puzzles asked for teams, you know, so there's the opportunity there of, of, you know, not, you, you don't have to be this giant Gunda one stop shopping.

`[00:38:31]` Piggyback you can piggyback. So I'm know I'm very optimistic about that. that, you know, way of working,

`[00:38:41]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:38:41] what kind of advice do you give your graduating

`[00:38:44]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:38:44] students?

`[00:38:48]` Aye. When they're, when they're just going out. I S I say, if you can. Absolutely go to a firm where you will continue to learn. [00:39:00] it's a little old fashioned maybe cause it's, you know, may sound like the apprentice thing, but I think it's very true that, to really, grow. and I don't think it's just out of, you know, just out of, I mean, I think, you know, one should always, work at a place where you continue to learn and grow, but I think it's especially.

`[00:39:21]` Critical, when the students are graduating,

`[00:39:24]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:39:24] to think about that as a correction

`[00:39:26]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:39:26] totally as a criteria. And you know, that that gives them, and I'm talking about learning in kind of any dimension. Okay. It may not be, you know, a firm where they have the greatest projects, but they do, then they construct them impeccably the, you know, so, the definition of, of, you know, what to learn.

`[00:39:48]` You know, it is, you know, is expansive. We have a lot to learn, you know, but, as long as they don't go, they don't get too pigeonholed, which leads to going brain dead.

`[00:40:01]` [00:40:00] **Craig Verzone:** [00:40:01] Those does theoretical discourse survive after school or outside the university classrooms. Oh,

`[00:40:08]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:40:08] I absolutely think so. I mean, I think that.

`[00:40:12]` Well, you know, you, you kind of look out there about how, you know, I think that the discourse, the design discourse has, has just gotten so much better. I mean, look at Tara, this, this thing you're doing Tara, Graham's look at how, programs like the Cooper Hewitt national design awards has stepped up to stress.

`[00:40:33]` Try to, you know, say design matters. you know, you know, you know, uncle Pete put together, you know, Spacemaker press because he wasn't happy with, you know,

`[00:40:44]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:40:44] space makers no longer.

`[00:40:45]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:40:45] Well, I know, but you know, I like to think that, you know, that has inspired, you know, other folks to just really make a point of, having a critical voice.

`[00:40:57]`so I mean, I think it's, it's building, it [00:41:00] still needs a lot of effort. But, I think, I think we all also are benefiting from, a lot of attention to landscape in landscape architecture. Do you think the

`[00:41:10]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:41:10] popular presses is looking into the field?

`[00:41:15]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:41:15] Absolutely. Yeah. I mean, why else would time? He's like what, you know, I mean, it's shocking.

`[00:41:23]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:41:23] Right? How did you like making the interviews with CNN times three 60? What, what was that like?

`[00:41:28]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:41:28] Yeah. well, I mean, I loved it. I mean, again, you know, with, I think even larger agenda I have about education. You know, the chance to, get out there and, you know, talk to, you know, not, you know, the choir, you know, well often, you know, even design audiences, aren't the choir, you know, but you know, a public beyond, you know, design art, you know, you know, I've, I've, you know, I've always tried to make that effort talking, going to conferences with engineers and so on and so [00:42:00] forth.

`[00:42:00]` You know, but clearly, you know, those, you know, those venues have more popular press, you know, is fantastic. I mean, I just am always saying, I'm so glad you're interested in the work. You know, I have to say, you know, there is a lot of hype too, you know, and I'm very skeptical of it. A lot of times I used to actually in.

`[00:42:27]` Say to folks who would, you know, call the dirt studio, I'd say, do they really want to talk about the work? Or do they want to talk to the chicken, the hard hat, because there's a lot of hype, you know,

`[00:42:41]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:42:41] did you see that in there? The line of

`[00:42:42]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:42:42] questioning? yeah, often, you know, they, you know, they, you know, they, the press can't help, but to, you know, still, you know, be starstruck.

`[00:42:54]` You know, and, you know, hero worshipers. And I think that that [00:43:00] is so antithetical. you know, I mean, that's, that's, what's interesting. I mean, I always, it's very interesting. If you look at design magazines now of those magazines that are willing to name every single person on the team. Okay. I've literally had press say we don't have room enough to.

`[00:43:18]` 10 fit the whole team. Do you know the amount of trouble I've gotten, gotten into, I've been threatened to be sued? You know, I've been, I've been fired off teams, you know, because of this thing of, you know, the hero designer, the single name, hero designer, designer, I think it's pretty interesting, you know, the number of, of firms that, you know, don't use their names anymore, right?

`[00:43:44]` Like, yeah.

`[00:43:48]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:43:48] So you think there's a need for this audio discourse and you don't think that we're at whacked here trying to, upstart?

`[00:43:55]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:43:55] No, not at all. I mean, I think the more, you know, the [00:44:00] more critical voices are out there, absolutely. You know, the better. And I think getting at, a new media, which is very savvy with.

`[00:44:11]` You know, people strapped to their headphones more than to, you know, a magazine is very, very smart, very smart. And I also, think that, this more, you know, kind of in depth kind of conversation, that gets gets at more of an operative, Kind of level, I think is just so much more, again, instructional or educational for colleagues and for, you know, colleagues kind of young and old, you know, because it's not, you know, you know, if.

`[00:44:48]` It's not about a bunch of Alcalay accolades and you know, what do you, you know? Yeah. I mean, you asked me what I was working on now, but it wasn't, it was more about asking, how are you working [00:45:00] now? You've

`[00:45:01]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:45:01] been developing over the past couple of years of rather ambitious project, a book entitled, toxic beauty it field guide, the derelict terrain.

`[00:45:11]` How's it coming. What are the challenges you're facing?

`[00:45:16]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:45:16] All right. Well, it's mutated. I've always been resistant to doing the book in that I am very skeptical of vanity press. and I hate to write, I hate it. toxic beauty started out as a lecture, and I finally realized that it should stay a lecture, because it really was more of a manifest Festo.

`[00:45:45]` And it's a rant. And I think rants are better as spoken word. I've had this

`[00:45:52]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:45:52] in my wishlist for four years

`[00:45:53]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:45:53] on. I know I was so mad that they listed on him. That'd be [00:46:00] waiting. I know, but well, hopefully, hopefully our very outdated website. Could you take

`[00:46:06]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:46:06] another form that was that you could distribute, because I think there are a lot of, there are a lot of practitioners like myself.

`[00:46:13]` We're very curious about this, this world that you practice in. I'm curious about, the language that the codes

`[00:46:22]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:46:22] approaches,

`[00:46:22]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:46:22] because we know we have no bearing on, on your world because it doesn't, it doesn't exist so far beyond

`[00:46:29]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:46:29] or the studio. Well, I'll tell you, I. one, because I do think it's medium, you know, of choice these days.

`[00:46:37]` And although I'm a Luddite, I'm trying desperately to catch up with the web. I think that there's a few things. When I, when I, there were three parts of the book. Okay. the so-called manifesto, which I called the ground rules. Okay. And the second part, the, the field work, which were the projects, [00:47:00] which, you know, Princeton, architectural press would call the monograph.

`[00:47:04]`basically ideally the website, when it gets, you know, renewed will outline some of these ground rules. The dirt studio, and then use the projects as I wanted to, not as, you know, a fashion show. But as, examples of the effort to, establish those ground rules or fulfill those ground rules.

`[00:47:29]` The third part of the book, which was my favorite part was the handbook and the toxic handbook has actually been the thing that has received the most attention and is what. I'm saying now I'd like to have as a web based publication, a couple of things, it's the techno it's, it focuses on the technologies and those things change, you know, almost hourly.

`[00:47:57]` So it's going to be much more, I think, [00:48:00] appropriately web based. I want it to be free and wholly accessible. and, And the part again, if me, as educator wants to make, you know, make the, what is extremely hard information to access accessible. So there are the philosophies and everything like that, which I hope the website will take care of and the other kind of educational, or the kind of, nitty gritty of the practice.

`[00:48:36]` Hopefully the toxic handbook

`[00:48:39]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:48:39] walks in the book, but we're looking forward to that website. Okay. Best and worst. What do you really enjoy doing in your practice on a day to day

`[00:48:49]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:48:49] basis?

`[00:48:53]` Drawing with a number two pencil. Cool. Such an old fashioned gal are [00:49:00] nice. Yeah. Actually it's still my favorite. I love sitting down at the desk and hashing it out.

`[00:49:12]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:49:12] And what are your, what are your recurrent gripes about the day to day and the practice?

`[00:49:19]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:49:19] Oh boy. Well, I would say two things. One that's I think general and the other that may be particular. And in general, you know, you'll hear me, if, and if you asked anybody, I go ballistic in the studio when the role of the designer is not respected.

`[00:49:45]`and, I think it's, Again, a big, a big thing that landscapes need to do, and that is assert their role, you know, not, you know, in a bitchy way, you know, but just to be very clear, [00:50:00] about what their role is on a project and, and hold firm and insist on, on, A very active role. I mean, I think that's why more and more, it's very, it's tricky to negotiate that with these collaborative teams and still the old, old model of landscape architects being sub, you know, to folks.

`[00:50:21]` So,

`[00:50:22]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:50:22] but also these bigger teams are dealing with projects that. Are quite large in scope. And so the landscape architectural component is a

`[00:50:31]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:50:31] tiny percentage. No, but, but see, we, we've got to, we've got to convince them otherwise or show them otherwise that, I mean,

`[00:50:41]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:50:41] but even within that percentage, I mean, sometimes we need to take that percentage and we don't play

`[00:50:48]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:50:48] well.

`[00:50:49]` Exactly. But I guess, I guess what I mean by that is we're more, what I have found is that. You know, we have the chance to get involved in [00:51:00] everything, including how building systems loop through the landscape. You know? So I do think that there's, there's more of a role, maybe not in implementation or what is kind of under the landscape budget, but in terms of this more kind of holistic view of projects, right.

`[00:51:22]` So, usually

`[00:51:23]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:51:23] equates to a bit of extra

`[00:51:25]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:51:25] work. Correct. But it's, again, all this part of the negotiation, you know, which I mean, on the other side of this wall where we're negotiating right now with, a big collaborative team and a giant, You know, we've had to kind of state dirt, does this, there does this dirt bleeds this, you know, and, and actually this has come with years of the story.

`[00:51:49]` Can you get that?

`[00:51:51]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:51:51] Can you get that telephone conversation that, that, that meeting. Soon enough in a project. I mean, D do you have that opportunity or are sometimes it's [00:52:00] decisions already made before? And

`[00:52:01]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:52:01] that's, that's, what's really critical. And I think that's, I think what that's, what's changing our practice is that we're getting in more and more at the, you know, the onset of Raja exactly.

`[00:52:13]` Before we're kind of relegated to a piece, you know? So I think that's a significant change, hopefully when that's taking hold. The other particular frustration, headbanging, is, you know, has to do with the realm I operate within. we had, you know, of the, of the post-industrial sites. and you know, I just, I just throw up my hands sometimes and say either they don't get it, or they don't want to get it.

`[00:52:48]` And, you know, I'm shit out of luck, you know, as far as I said, I wasn't going to swear. but you know, in terms of the project and, you [00:53:00] know, Craig, I, you know, I constantly say, and I'm pretty convinced that, this work isn't going to take hold for another decade or two. And that's another devotion I have to teaching.

`[00:53:14]` It

`[00:53:14]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:53:14] keeps you in the, keeps your feet in the

`[00:53:17]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:53:17] field, I'm educating the next, the folks who are going to do it. Right. If, you know, cause you know, you know, you know, I don't know if I'm going to do it, you know? So trying, do you feel

`[00:53:32]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:53:32] that you're, you have responsibility or burden to innovate? Come up with something

`[00:53:37]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:53:37] new?

`[00:53:40]` No,

`[00:53:41]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:53:41] where you're defining a new field of practice.

`[00:53:47]`**Julie Bargmann:** [00:53:47] Hmm. Well, I guess when I hear myself in an answer to that question, I, I say the word role a lot. So I think that again, and I'll, I'll [00:54:00] rewind all the way back to what I said about how artists operate. I think. You know, if there's anything new here is, you know, a, a role that I'm trying to, demonstrate, and, encourage inspire, invent.

`[00:54:20]` Yeah. Tara grams.

`[00:54:24]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:54:24] You recently worked on a. Competition entry with, the team of Michael van Valkenburgh among many others in your, project was entitled. Your team was entitled Terra grant. Where did your team come up

`[00:54:37]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:54:37] with the name? it was, it was definitely a referenced Archigram so of course, ARCA, Tara, you know, we had to use a land.

`[00:54:48]`land-based part of the name and. you know, I think, we were trying to, emulate, the kind of forward-looking process-based, approach, [00:55:00] that Archigram took. I also have to say, I, I was a great, proponent of naming the team.

`[00:55:10]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:55:10] I didn't know that.

`[00:55:10]` **Julie Bargmann:** [00:55:10] Well, I'm talking about naming teams in general, because again, I think there's a thing about, you know, about recognizing the dynamic of this entity, that one creates, which Michael was primarily, responsible for forming.

`[00:55:27]`and you know, he very much liked that idea because, otherwise, you know, and it still did it, it still was Michael van Valkenburgh scheme. Right. but there was the spirit there that we were coming together as a new force.

`[00:55:43]` **Craig Verzone:** [00:55:43] Wow. I hope that our new podcast can follow up on your spirit. And on that note, let's conclude our first delivery of teragrams today.
