Stefan Rotzler studied History of Art at the Zurich University before becoming a gardener. Following this hands-on experience, Rotzler opted to study landscape architecture at the ITR Technical School in Rapperswil, Switzerland where he graduated in one of the first classes of the newly created professional program. After graduation, he worked with the town planning office of Zurich for a few years and then opened his own office. In 1989 he began his collaboration with Matthias Krebs, who together have made projects for gardens, public spaces, sports facilities, infrastructure primarily in Europe. In 2007, the Swiss publishing firm Niggli released the first monograph of the Rotzler Krebs collaboration. Rotzler has taught in the landscape program at Rapperswil and has participated widely in international competitions, juries and workshops. Special thanks to Merete Vindum for dispatch research and preparation. May 28, 2009.
