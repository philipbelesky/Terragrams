René Bihan joins Terragrams for the 20th dispatch. Bihan is a registered landscape architect and the managing principal of the San Francisco office of the SWA Group. He grew up with a nursery in his backyard and has been in the practice for more than 2 decades. He is a commissioner for the San Francisco Arts Commission and has designed and managed projects such as Beijing Finance Street - 18 new urban blocks in West Beijing, the City College of San Francisco Master Plan, the Hong Kong Cultural Harbour, and the Salt Lake City Redevelopment of Blocks 75 and 76. René discusses much of his current work as well as the 50th birthday of the SWA Group, his trajectory from the nursery to the studio, sustainable site planning and what drives his design process.
