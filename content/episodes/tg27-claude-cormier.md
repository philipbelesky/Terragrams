Claude Cormier grew up on a farm and went on to study in agronomy and plant sciences at the University of Guelph. However, in search for a different perspective on nature, he entered the University of Toronto to study landscape architecture. After practicing for some time in Toronto and Montreal, he returned to school in the early 90â€™s to obtain a Master's in Landscape Architecture from the Harvard Graduate School of Design.

In 1995, he founded his office, [Claude Cormier Landscape Architects](https://www.claudecormier.com/). Claude has been described as belonging to "the second generation of landscape architects, known as conceptualists". Having emerged concurrent with postmodern architecture and on the heels of the conceptual art movement, the 'conceptualists' approach is distinguished by the predominance accorded the concept or governing idea that spurs a project and defines its every detail, from start to finish. This viewpoint differs radically from the functionalist imperatives of modernism. Within this camp, the practice of Cormier and his team is distinguished by his insistence to peel back the historic, economic, botanical, ecological and socio-cultural strata (whether hidden or manifest) that make up the sites on and with which they work.
