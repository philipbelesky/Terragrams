Claude Cormier grew up on a farm and went on to study in agronomy and plant sciences at the University of Guelph hoping to cross-breed flowers. However, in search for a different perspective on nature, he entered the University of Toronto to study landscape architecture. After practicing for some time in Toronto and Montreal, he returned to school in the early 90’s to obtain a Master’s in Landscape Architecture from the Harvard Graduate School of Design. In 1995 he founded his office Claude Cormier Landscape Architects. The Claude Cormier wikipedia page states, “Cormier belongs to the second generation of landscape architects, known as “conceptualists”. Having emerged concurrent with postmodern architecture and on the heels of the conceptual art movement, this approach is distinguished by the predominance accorded the concept or governing idea that spurs a project and defines its every detail, from start to finish. This conceptualist viewpoint differs radically from the functionalist imperatives of modernism. Within this camp itself, the practice of Cormier and his team is distinguished by his insistence to peel back the historic, economic, botanical, ecological and socio-cultural strata (whether hidden or manifest) that make up the sites on and with which they work.” Continuing from the Wikipedia entry, “A single formula stands as the most concise definition of Cormier’s philosophy: Artificial, not fake. What he seeks first and foremost is authenticity—a “true fake.” In other words, he strives to display the constructed nature of landscape in its truest form.” In conclusion, “Cormier seeks to stir emotions and give meaning in order to invigorate public space by blurring the boundaries between design and art, natural and artificial, and real and surreal.” Special thanks to Terje Ong for dispatch research and preparation.
