Marti Franch is a Catalan landscape architect who has studied in Barcelona and Greenwich, England and trained in the offices of Buro Keifer in Berlin and Buro B+B in Amsterdam. Franch established his office Estudi Martí Franch EMF in 1999 to independently pursue his interest in designing the landscape. Presently, EMF is composed of landscape architects, architects and agricultural technical engineers and works on projects spanning a wide range of scales, clients and functions. Franch’s garden project for the new museum, Can Framis, in Barcelona was a finalist for the 6th European Biennial of Landscape Architecture. Franch teaches in the Masters Program for Landscape Architecture Masters in both the School of Architecture in Barcelona (ETSAB) as well as in the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB). In dispatch 30, Franch talks about his garden project for the Can Framis Museum, his thoughts regarding professional practice in Spain, his preferred project from the finalists of the 6th Biennial as well as his ideas regarding the conceptual process of design. Special thanks to the organizers of the 6th Biennial of European Landscape Architecture for their support and assistance in organizing the dispatches originating from their event.
