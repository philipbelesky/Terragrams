Kongjian Yu was born into a farming family and grew up farming aside his father. He graduated from the Beijing Forestry University in 1987 with a degree in Landscape Architecture and successfully presented his thesis entitled _"The Quantitative Models for Landscape Assessment‚Äù_. After five years of teaching, he left for the United States to study at the Harvard Graduate School of Design and receive his [Doctor of Design](https://www.gsd.harvard.edu/doctoral-programs/doctor-of-design/).

Yu then worked in the Laguna Beach office of SWA before returning to China in 1997 and establishing the School of Landscape Architecture at Peking University. One year later, he launched [Turenscape](https://www.turenscape.com/en/home/index.html): a private multi-disciplinary design office covering the work of architecture, landscape architecture, and urban design. Today, the practice boasts a staff of more than 600 professionals. In 2003, he expanded the symbiosis between Turenscape and Peking University by founding the [Graduate School of Landscape Architecture](https://www.isd.pku.edu.cn/info/1460/2594.htm).

In Dispatch 29, Yu discusses his Big Foot Revolution, the birth of Turenscape, the origins of the Peking University programs, and his influence on the Chinese national debate concerning urban development.
