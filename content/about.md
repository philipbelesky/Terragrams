## About Terragrams

Terragrams is a podcast series disseminating discussions about the landscape. As our societal conscience and appreciation of the landscape heightens, Terragrams provides a wide portal into landscape architecture and the lives and thoughts of the professionals who shape it. The project aims at capturing, distributing and archiving these voices. It is an easily accessible, open audio digital archive aimed at collecting first-hand, face-to-face conversations between and about people in and around the field.

Further recorded dispatches include Mia Lehrer, Jordi Badia, Tone Lindheim, Sylvia Karres, Joao Ferreira Nunes, Manuel Ruisánchez, Marianne Levinson, Granit Mayslits Kassif & Udi Kassif, Berrie van Elderen & Frits van Loon, Barbara & Ittai Aronson, Dirk Sijmons, Fritz Haeg, Mona Talbott, Lorenzo Romito, Stephan Tischer, Robert Schäfer and Michel Desvigne.

Terragrams is hosted by Craig Verzone, a practicing landscape architect and partner at [Verzone Woods Architectes](https://www.vwa.ch), a multi-disciplinary design studio in Vevey, Switzerland. Verzone carries degrees from Cornell and Harvard University in the fields of Landscape Architecture and Urban Design. As an American Academy of Rome Prize recipient, he studied the landscape of collective housing in post-war Rome. Notable projects include the park at the foot of Le Corbusier’s Unité d’Habitation in Briey, France, the Las Margas Village in northern Spain, the Agro-Urban Park of Geneva, the Market Square of Vevey as well as the upcoming Birkhauser book entitled [Food Urbanism](https://www.degruyter.com/view/title/529945?rskey=oNgfpl&result=1).

The re-broadcast of Terragrams is produced and edited by [Philip Belesky](https://philipbelesky.com). Philip is a lecturer at RMIT University and the manager of its [Master of Landscape Architecture program](http://landscapearchitecture.rmit.edu.au).
